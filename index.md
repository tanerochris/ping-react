## Hey there

Hey there you have gone through the [react](url) documentation and some resources here and there and you are ready to put this knowledge to use, you are not on yet "another tutorial" on react. Ping react is a practical tutorial that gets your hands dirty with building a full react application. In this tutorial I am going to show you how I built [spyo.com](url), a campaign platform where brands get support from their fans in a bid to grow. Spyo was built using [NextJs](url) -  A framework for building react application, MongoDB a NoSQL database on documents and Bulma react UI library kit. By the end of this tutorial you should have build your own Spyo, and leaned the underlaying react concepts.
