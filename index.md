## A Tutorial that shows you how to build a full react application using component Re-use.

Hey there you have gone through the [react](url) documentation and some resources here and there and you are

ready to put this knowledge to use, you are not on yet "another tutorial" on react. Ping react is a practical 

tutorial that gets your hands dirty with building a full react application. In this tutorial I am going to show 

you how I built [spyo.com](url), a campaign platform where brands get support from their fans in a bid to grow. 

Spyo was built using [NextJs](url) -  A framework for building react application, MongoDB a NoSQL database on 

documents and Bulma react UI library kit. By the end of this tutorial you should have build your own Spyo, and 

leaned the underlaying react concepts. 

## Lets get started
The first step to this tutorial will be installing the different tools required to build our       

application. We will start with NextJS which is a React framework which allows server site rendering and static 

site generation. I have been longtime fanboy of Express, I wanted to experiment with something new and I had read 

and heard alot about NextJs, so I went for it considering its seling points such as speed, I chose NextJs 

becausee of its speed, server side rendering and also good suport for SEO which was what I was looking for at the 

time.
